First thing i did was make the array of 0's in python 
in my function matrix which takes in height and width as
arguments. We want a 390 by 331 grid so to test if the array works
i did a print(matrix(390, 331)) which returned a huge array array's
with 0's.

The second objective was to take the data from the data each team recieved.
Made varables for all the matrix the cell_size and  TOP, LEFT.

Altogether in one for loop, I read in the file line by line skipping over the first index of every line 
by using line.split(',') to skipp the first comma and go straight to the numbers.
for x i jumped the first index and went straight for the index 1 since in python 
we count starting from 0. for y i jumped over the first to indexes to get my second
number. Then in implementated the calculations which were given to us on the powerpoint
so all or most of the data would fit into our matrix. 

Then since we are working with a huge amount of data again and a huge matrix at that 
i save the result into result .txt
